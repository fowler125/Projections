## Usage

To use the program, simply run the `FirstHalfStats.py` script with the following command:

The Program will run and grab all current games that are slated for that day. Once it grabs each team it will pair them together
and use the 1H stats from the 2022-23 season, Last 3 Games, Last Game, Home and Away Games. It will then display
each teams scores seperately based on the category and then combine the totals for each category respectfully.
